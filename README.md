In this project circuit, we are going to teach you making a sensitive dark sensor circuit. It is activated by a lack of light. It is a simple and powerful concept, which used transistor as a switch ON and OFF the light system automatically.

Light sensors are a type of photo detector that detect light. Different types of light sensors can be used to measure illuminance, respond to changes in the amount of light receive, or convert light to electricity.

To make this circuit, we are using LDR. LDR is a one type of photo resistor. Photo resistors, also known as light dependent resistor (LDR) are light sensitive device most often used to indicate the presence or absence of light, or to measure the light intensity.

LDR sensor is used for detecting the presence of surrounding light so that during the day time when sun is bright, the street light is switched off automatically. During the night time when there is no light, the LDR sends signal to microcontroller to turn on the street light.


Component List - 

To make this sensitive dark sensor circuit, we need some simple electronics component. You also can order assembled PCBs form JLCPCB. JLCPCB have its parts library. To check JLCPCB parts library, click here - https://jlcpcb.com/parts
All Component list have to been given below – 

Component List – 

•	Relay – 12v

•	Transistor – BC 547

•	Resistor – 10 KΩ

•	Diode – 1N 4007

•	LDR

•	LED – 12v

•	PCB

•	Power Source – DC 12v


Output of BC-547 Transistor

BC547 is an NPN Bipolar Junction Transistor. And like all other transistors BC547 has three pins. If we count it’s leg form left side then, then called the emitter, collector, and base

BC547 transistor acts as a switch between the collector and emitter. If the base of the transistor is given enough current, this switch closes and the current flows from the collector to the emitter.

So a small current to the base pin of the transistor switches the large current between the collector and the emitter.


Feature of Dark sensor

•	This project can be implemented in applications like automatic switching on of lights when it becomes dark.

•	This circuit can be part of a bigger circuit or project like home automation or home security system.

Hardware of this Amplifier Circuit

To make this amplifier circuit, we might need some electronics component. JLCPCB has its own parts library. JLCPCB has 200k+ in stock components, 24 hours rapid SMT assembly.

Circuit Connection – Step 1

To make this sensitive dark sensor circuit, 1st we connect rectifier diode with the circuit. There are two coil terminal of a relay. We connect rectifier diode anode and cathode terminal with coil leg of relay. 

The we connect 10 KΩ resistor with the circuit. Connect resistor one terminal with cathode leg of rectifier diode.
We utilize JLCPCB https://jlcpcb.com/RTA to printout our PCB.


Circuit Connection – Step 2

To glow light, now we need to connect DC-12v led light. Connect LED light positive leg with cathode leg of rectifier diode and LED light negative leg with anode leg of rectifier diode.

Now we need to connect transistor with the circuit. Connect BC-547 transistor “Base” leg with 10 KΩ resistor.


Circuit Connection – Step 3

This time we connect transistor “Collector” leg with negative leg of LED light. 

To control light, now we connect LDR with the circuit. We connect LDR one terminal with “Base” leg of transistor and it’s other terminal with “Emitter” leg of transistor.

Now we just need to connect power source with this sensor circuit. For power source, we are using DC – 12 volt power supply. We connect it’s negative cable with “Emitter” leg of transistor and power source positive cable with “cathode” leg of rectifier diode.


Soldering & Cleaning Amplifier Circuit

It’s the time to soldering and cut-off all extra leg of electronics component. Now we solder all component leg carefully and to make sure we need to check all of them for several times. We also remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection. For perfect inquiry, we should use liquid PCB cleaner to wash PCBs.


Final Part

Just power On DC-12v and made dark on LDR, then you will follow that, led light is glowing and make light on LDR, the LED light will be automatically off.

Thanks to JLCPCB for sponsor us such a quality PCB board.
