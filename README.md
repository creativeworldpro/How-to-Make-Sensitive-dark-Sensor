# How-to-Make-Sensitive-dark-Sensor
In this project circuit, we are going to teach you making a sensitive dark sensor circuit. It is activated by a lack of light. It is a simple and powerful concept, which used transistor as a switch ON and OFF the light system automatically. Light sensors are a type of photo detector that detect light. Different types of light sensors can be used to measure illuminance, respond to changes in the amount of light receive, or convert light to electricity. To make this circuit, we are using LDR. LDR is a one type of photo resistor. Photo resistors, also known as light dependent resistor (LDR) are light sensitive device most often used to indicate the presence or absence of light, or to measure the light intensity. LDR sensor is used for detecting the presence of surrounding light so that during the day time when sun is bright, the street light is switched off automatically. During the night time when there is no light, the LDR sends signal to microcontroller to turn on the street light.
